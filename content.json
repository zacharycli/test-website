            "fullText": "\"I wrote an algorithm that allows us to select a couple of possible parameters for our car, and alter them. The time taken to travel the track distance of 20m is on the y-axis, compared against the values of each parameter. The algorithm works by calculating the drag force on the car, comparing it to the thrust, and calculating overall acceleration. The program then takes this, multiplies by 0.001, and adds it to velocity. Then it multiplies the velocity by 0.001 and adds it to displacement. The 0.001 represents the portion of seconds simulated by each calculation. Because the acceleration varies, the smaller the value, the higher the precision. In future, I plan to improve the algorithm by giving it the capability to simulate the interplay between two changing parameters and to include a realistic thrust profile. Currently, I assume a continuous thrust of 10N, but this is unrealistic. Data for the canister is not readily available online, so I will likely use an approximation centred around rocketry.\"",

Several species, such as spirulina, are also edible, and high in a variety of nutrients. Our project revolves around cultivating these beneficial microbes to provide oxygen to astronauts without the issues of raising plants in space. We are also looking into bringing to light the fascinating material of silica aerogel and how it can develop space travel, exploration and survival."

It could, however, also have applications on Earth. Our design centres around photogrammetry: taking photos of the surface of the Earth and building them into a 3D model. To allow us sufficient time for this on our descent, we will be manufacturing a parafoil. We are currently investigating using two-axis control of the parafoil to control our descent. We also plan to carry out the new and revolutionary aerogel particle capture. This uses a material called silica aerogel to obtain particles, which can then be analysed."
