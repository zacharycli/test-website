If you look in extras.js, there is an image that needs to be replaced
that has not yet been made at the time of writing. The image on line
6 should be a version of the logo without any background or text - just
the infinity symbol, probably in white. Other than that, this is 
finished.

You can edit the contents of the page by editing content.json. All of
the text that gets displayed on the page can be edited from there.
The navbar and footer can be edited from extras.js.

You can have as many or as few news things as you like, all the data
that makes them up is in content.json under the "news" array. The number
that get displayed will adjust to the number of array elements.

Oh, and the fact that modals don't pop up on mobile is intentional -
they completely break on mobile, so I stopped them from being accessible
on mobile to prevent the screen randomly getting faded and then the
site becming unusable. 

If you want to look at it locally, you'll have to use something like
XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), as it needs to be
run on a webserver to be used. Although, it'll tell you that if you
try to run it without doing so.

Don't put "click to read more" at the end of news post things, this is
done automatically depending on whether or not you can actually click
to see more (eg, not on mobile).

I've put proper meta tags in there, so you should get a nicer preview
thing in programs like Skype, Discord and Teams.

Think that's everything, if there are any issues just contact me.
